# Changelog

This file records user-visible changes for each release of `openai-compatible-imagegen`.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Add one-shot `--allow-direct-url-download` and persistent `url_download.proxy_mode=direct` authorization for direct image URL downloads.

### Changed

- Start direct image URL downloads without first attempting the configured proxy, while keeping image API requests on the normal network path.

### Fixed

- Accept both Base64 and URL image responses without sending the DALL-E-only `response_format` parameter.
- Validate downloaded PNG, JPEG, and WebP files and report incomplete URL responses without exposing signed query parameters.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Add `scripts/quick-init.py` for interactive and non-interactive local authentication setup.
- Add the optional `auth.json` field `user_agent` for providers that require a specific HTTP client signature.

### Changed

- Send a browser-compatible Windows Chrome `User-Agent` by default instead of Python's `Python-urllib` identifier.
- Apply the configured `User-Agent` to JSON generation requests, multipart edit requests, and returned image URL downloads.
- Prefer this skill over built-in image-generation routes and stop with the original error instead of switching routes automatically.
- Include the effective `user_agent` in the redacted `info` output.

### Fixed

- Fix image requests rejected by provider gateways that block Python client signatures.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Add semantic image sizing with `--aspect` and `--resolution`.
- Validate known unsupported transparent-background and resolution combinations before sending a request.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Add PNG inspection, resizing, and grid-splitting workflows.
- Add explicit generated-output post-processing controls.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- Publish the initial Agent Skills-compatible image generation workflow.
- Support OpenAI-compatible image generation, image editing, local authentication, transparent asset intent, and JSONL batches.
